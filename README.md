# Circle_detection-using-Opencv
Circle detection finds a varitey of uses in biomedical applications,ranging from iris detetion to white blood cell segmentation.There are two approaches generally used for detecting a circle object in a digital image,they area circle detection method based on Hough Transform and a circle detection methodbased on a geometrical charecteristics A circle is represented mathematically as (X-xcenter)2+(y-ycenter)2=r2,where (xcenter and ycenter)is the center of the circle,and r is the radius of the circle.

##Technologies Used: 
Opencv and numpy libraries are used for this detection.
Versions used to run the code are as follows: Opencv=4.4.0 numpy=1.16.5

The Circle Hough Transform(CHT) is a basic feature extraction technique used in digital image processing for detecting circles in imperfect images.The circle candidates are produced by "voting" in Hough parameter space and then selecting local maxima in an accumulator matrix.
